Seacloud
========
Seacloud is a Whatsapp bot that creates a chat channel through a Whatsapp contact. It is similar to having a Whatsapp group, except your details are never shared so people you are chatting with will never know your actual number unless you give it out.

In short it's kinda like IRC where you can join the channel and your actual number will never be known and you can take any identity you fancy; anonymously.

FAQ
===

###What do I need to host a Seacloud channel service?
You first need a side contact, aka: a contact number that you own, but are not actively using. Then you need all the details for that contact such as its ID and password which you can get by using Miss Venom to sniff your details or Yowsup-cli to both register and get the details.

###Can I modify Seacloud and/or use it as a base for my own bot/service?
Sure you can, Seacloud was originally designed to be an anonymous chat channel, but also serves as an example code base for developers who would like to design/code a Whatsapp bot/service.

It is frowned upon though to modify the code base maliciously and still pass as a Seacloud service.
